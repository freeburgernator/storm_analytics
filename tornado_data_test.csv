This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.",This tornado developed just to the south of the first tornado in Newton County as that tornado was dissipating. It caused extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several homes just west of the Decatur Country Club. It also destroyed the cart shack at the country club and caused extensive tree damage on the golf course.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering.

Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",This tornado snapped an uprooted numerous trees along its path.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.","This tornado caused a path of extensive damage in northeast Neshoba, extreme northwest Kemper, extreme southeast Winston, and southwest Noxubee Counties. The most intense damage occurred in a several mile area from extreme northeast Neshoba County into extreme southeast Winston County. Much of the damage in the core of the tornado in this area was rated as high end EF-3 to EF-5. The three fatalities occurred in northwest Kemper County when a strapped down double-wide mobile home was thrown a distance of approximately 300 yards into a treeline, and then obliterated with the debris and framing scattered many hundreds of yards down the path. There was no indication of ground impacts between the original site of the mobile home and where it ended up to indicate that the mobile home bounced extensively as it traveled. Two traditional frame brick homes in southeast Winston County were completely leveled with only a few small parts of interior walls standing. New vehicles were thrown or rolled hundreds of yards before being wrapped into trees and left almost beyond recognition. In parts of northeast Neshoba and northwest Kemper Counties, there was very high end tree damage with extensive denuding and debarking of trees, along with areas where the ground was scoured out to a depth of two feet in places, and asphalt was scoured off pavement.

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county.

In response, surface dew points in the middle to upper 60s surged northward into Central Alabama and deep vertical wind shear increased, providing support for tornadic supercell development. A weakening line of thunderstorms moved into northwest Central Alabama early Friday morning. The southern end of this line intensified by mid day as it encountered a more unstable airmass. South of the line, supercells formed in Mississippi and tracked eastward into west Central Alabama. The entire system pushed east across the area over the course of about twelve hours, exiting east Central Alabama in the early morning hours on Saturday, April 16. In addition to the thirty tornadoes, the storm system produced widespread straight line wind damage and numerous large hail reports.","The first segment in this tornado track initially touched down north of County Road 86 in Greene County.

Irma continued to intensify and became a major hurricane over the eastern Atlantic on September 1st.  After undergoing a brief period of weakening on September 2nd, Irma once again strengthened into a major hurricane on September 3rd and maintained major hurricane status through September 10th when it made landfall on the southwest Florida coast.  During this extended period as a major hurricane, Irma set numerous intensity records for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin.  Maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph, making Irma the strongest storm on record to exist in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Also, Irma���s 185 mph maximum sustained winds are tied for the second strongest maximum winds all time in an Atlantic hurricane.  The minimum central pressure reached during Irma���s life cycle was 914 mb which is the lowest pressure on record by an Atlantic hurricane outside of the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Furthermore, Irma maintained Category 5 status for 3 consecutive days which is the longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane.  Irma stayed on a general westward track through September 5th when it began a gradual turn to the west-northwest.  On this west-northwestward track, Irma eventually skirted along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th before turning northward toward Florida on September 10th.  Irma officially made landfall at Marco Island, FL at 3:35 pm September 10 as a Category 3 hurricane.  Following landfall, Irma tracked to the north-northwest and eventually the northwest as it progressed up the western side of the Florida peninsula.  Irma steadily weakened during this time and was downgraded to a tropical storm near the big bend of Florida at 8:00 am on September 11th.  Through the rest of September 11th, Irma tracked to the northwest into southern Georgia and widespread impacts occurred across the Southeast.||Despite the fact that the center of Irma tracked well to the west of the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina region, it still caused significant impacts due to heavy rainfall, strong winds, tornadoes, and storm surge.  Feeder bands around Irma continuously moved onshore on September 11th and produced very heavy rainfall rates with rainfall totals generally ranging from 3 to 9 inches.  The peak storm total rainfall of 9.07��� was recorded by a CoCoRaHS observer near Beaufort, SC.  Daily record rainfall totals for September 11th were recorded at all 3 climate sites in the area: 5.51��� at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.53��� at Downtown Charleston (KCXM), and 4.74��� at the Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV).  This widespread heavy rain resulted in several reports of flash flooding with water entering homes and businesses.  Wind damage produced numerous power outages across the region with some damage to structures and numerous downed trees.  The strongest winds were confined to coastal locations, but frequent gusts into the 40-50 mph range occurred well inland.  The maximum sustained wind recorded was 59 mph by the Weatherflow site on the Folly Beach Pier (XFOL) and the maximum wind gust recorded was 76 mph by the Weatherflow site near Beaufort (XBUF).  One fatality and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes and across roadways in southeast South Carolina.  The entire southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging from 3 to 6 feet.  This storm surge produced numerous reports of 4 to 6 feet of inundation above ground level, mainly along the southeast South Carolina coast.  A peak surge of 4.87 feet occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 2:00 pm while a peak surge of 5.63 feet occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 5:42 am.

During the closest point of approach to east-central Florida during the early morning hours of September 11, rain bands associated with the inner core elongated west-to-east and lifted through northwest Osceola County, Lake County and western Orange County. Due to the large size of the wind field, a long duration of damaging tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force was experienced across all of east-central Florida. There were no direct hurricane-related fatalities, however 10 indirect fatalities occurred during the evacuation and recovery phases of the hurricane. Preliminary damage estimates across east central Florida exceeded $1.3 billion.||A storm surge of 2-3 feet affected the coast of Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River Counties, and 3-4 feet of storm surge impacted the coast of Brevard and Volusia Counties. Moderate to major beach erosion occurred along the entire east-central Florida coastline. Water levels rose within the coastal lagoon system generally rose between 1 and 3 feet (although locally up to 4.5 feet within a few constricted areas of the lagoon, primarily within north Brevard and Volusia Counties) due to coastal surge and run-off from heavy rain and slow drainage to the Atlantic through the inlets. River flooding caused to enter some homes adjacent to the Halifax River, primarily in Ormond Beach, Holly Hill and north Daytona Beach. Many docks and boat houses along the Indian, Banana and Halifax Rivers were damaged from the combination of high water and wave action. ||Rainfall totals of 10-15 inches were widespread across east-central Florida. The highest totals occurred in a swath from northern St. Lucie County to far southern Indian River County, where accumulations reached 15 to nearly 22 inches. A significant portion of this rain fell during the early morning hours of September 10 as excessive rain bands trained onshore ahead of the main rain area associated with Hurricane Irma. Flooding entered several homes and many roadways became impassible. Hurricane rain bands also resulted in flooding of homes and roadways in many other areas later on September 10, including Fellsmere (Indian River County) where a dozen people were rescued from flood waters and north Merritt Island (Brevard County) where water approached or entered several homes. During the early morning hours of September 11, flooding breached several hundred homes and resulted in the rescue of 200 residents in Orlo Vista (Orange County) when a lake and adjacent retention ponds overflowed. ||Widespread heavy rain fell within the St. Johns River basin and caused the entire river (from Cocoa in Brevard County to Astor in Lake County) to reach flood stage. The Astor area was the first to reach flood stage during the afternoon of September 10, then Cocoa very early on September 11 and Lake Harney that evening, Deland very early on September 12 and Sanford very late on September 14. All points along the river eventually reached moderate to major flood stage, impacting adjacent homes, structures, property and roadways. The river remained in flood for well over one month. ||Ten tornadoes were confirmed, including eight within Brevard County (one EF-0, six EF-1, and one EF-2), one in Volusia County (EF-1) and one in Lake County (EF-1).

Storm surveys over the subsequent few days uncovered 25 tornadoes -the most ever recorded here in one outbreak.  On the 19th, low pressure had organized over southeast Kansas with a stationary front reaching east into the central Appalachians.  Plentiful moisture streamed northward from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of the system.  The Kansas low moved along the front and swung a cold front eastward.  Instability, strong upper level winds, and significant changes in wind speed and direction with height helped cause a large squall line to develop ahead of the low and its cold front.  The squall line caused severe weather from the eastern Great Lakes to the Red River Valley.  Over two dozen tornadoes spun up along the line as it crossed southern Indiana and central Kentucky.  Despite the numerous twisters and the fact that they struck during the overnight hours, there were no fatalities or injuries.",An NWS Storm Survey confirmed an EF-1 tornado with winds estimated to be 90 mph.  The path length was approximately a quarter of a mile with a width of 80 yards.  A barn was destroyed and large hardwood trees were snapped 30 feet off the ground.

Good instability, moisture convergence, and high convective available potential energy was present along and to the east of the dryline.  Wind shear was also high over the area, and a low level jet of high winds allowed for storms to continue into the late evening hours.  These conditions contributed to thunderstorms that produced large hail, strong wind, flash flooding, and tornadoes across the Permian Basin.","A thunderstorm moved across Howard County and produced a tornado near Big Spring.  Eyewitness reports from storm chasers and spotters in the area indicate that the tornado began at 6:13 pm CDT just south of Texas State Highway 176, approximately 10 miles west of Big Spring.  The tornado then moved southeastward over open fields, bounded by Natural Dam Lake to its west and Wilkinson Road just to its east.  The tornado continued on this southeast track along Salt Lake, eventually crossing Interstate 20 at approximately 6:32 pm CDT.  ||South of Interstate 20, the tornado exhibited erratic movement, being described by chasers and spotters as being nearly stationary in a field.  Examination of radar imagery showed the primary storm circulation moved slowly southeastward to approximately half a mile northwest of the intersection of Lintner Road and Rockhouse Road by 6:37 pm CDT, before turning eastward.  The tornado continued to move east, with the southern periphery of the tornado affecting Home #1.  The tornado then began to move northeastward, crossing nearly directly over Home #2 around 6:40 pm CDT.  A slight east northeast turn allowed for only the tornado's northern periphery to affect Home #3 along Cauble Road around 6:42 pm CDT.||The tornado moved southward along or near Cauble Road.  The tornado continued its erratic behavior, moving southwestward and re-entering the same field as previous around 6:48 pm CDT.  The tornado then turned west-northwestward, eventually becoming quasi-stationary just east of the Home #1 between 6:52 pm and 6:54 pm CDT, before moving westward, just north of Home #1.  Residents at home #1 described how long the tornado lasted and felt the tornado had impacted them twice. The tornado dissipated approximately 1.5 miles west of Home #1 around 7 pm CDT.||The damage assessment team looked at several different indicators to determine tornado intensity.  At Home #2, which likely was the closest and strongest structure to the tornado during the most intense portion of the tornado's life cycle, the entire roof was destroyed and exterior walls on this well-constructed residence were partially collapsed.  This damage indicator suggests an EF-3 intensity with wind speeds estimated at 140-160 mph.  In the adjacent field east of Home #2, a 640 type pump jack was blown over.  The assessment team also looked at tree damage at Home #2.  Both softwood and hardwood trees were viewed on the property.  Damage to these large trees was indicative of high end EF-2 to low end EF-3 damage.||Home #1 and Home #3 experienced tornado damage indicative of EF-2 damage.  In the examples shown, large sections of the roof were removed, but with the walls still standing.  At Home #3, there were power poles that were snapped approximately five feet off the ground.  Wind speeds at this residence are estimated at 115 to 125 mph.  At Home #1, trees were uprooted.  Wind speeds are estimated at this location of 105 to 115 mph.

The persistent feed of moist air from the Gulf produced a warm and humid air mass that resulted in afternoon temperatures well above normal, topping out in the 80s across the forecast area Thursday afternoon. Warmer air aloft produced an atmospheric cap that prohibited thunderstorm development well ahead of the front. As a result, a squall line of severe convection developed in the vicinity of the cold front and moved across the Delta region. Much of the damage associated with the squall line was produced by two intense severe storms. The first storm moved across Ashley and Chicot Counties in southeast Arkansas during mid afternoon before tracking across Washington County in northwest Mississippi. The first storm produced an EF-1 tornado near Crossett, AR. The second storm moved across northeast Louisiana into the Mississippi Delta region, producing an EF-1 tornado near Sondheimer, Louisiana and another tornado in Nitta Yuma, Mississippi. In addition to tornadoes, severe storms along the squall line downed trees and power lines and produced golf ball sized hail. ||The squall line began to weaken as it continued across the Mississippi Delta, pulling away from the associated low pressure system and moving into a region where the air mass was more stable.

This occurred during the late few days of August.  The system slowly intensified under weak steering currents and moved onshore the Louisiana coast on the 3rd.  Tropical Storm Lee was extremely slow moving at this point and consequently dumped excessive rainfall across southeast Louisiana.  A sharp upper trough began to take shape in the central U.S. on September 4th as upper energy dug southeast from Canada.  As this occurred, the remnants of Lee began to accelerate northeastward in association with the advancing upper trough.  The remnants of Lee traveled very quickly along the advancing front, racing across Georgia on the 5th.  Rain bands began to affect the area late on the 4th, but most of these were light to moderate.  On the 5th, persistent heavy rain impacted northwest Georgia and resulted in minor flooding.  Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.  However, only one thunderstorm cell actually netted a tornado, which caused considerable damage in Cherokee county, just northwest of Atlanta.||As the outer remnant feeder bands moved away from the area during the mid-evening, the remnant core of Tropical Storm Lee passed by just to the west across northwest Alabama.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall.  ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained.

The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon.
