Focusing first on the heavy rain and flooding, most areas north of a line from Kearney-Hastings-York measured at least 2-4 per NWS observers/CoCoRaHS/ radar estimation, with localized pockets of 5-7. Some of the overall-heaviest rain targeted the following three areas: 1) Much of Polk County (including a whopping 8.37 a few miles northeast of Osceola and 6.95 in town)...2) Much of Nance County (radar estimates of a widespread 3-5)...3) A roughly 10-mile wide corridor running from the north side of Hastings to around Aurora (widespread 3-5 and up to 6.70 near Phillips). Of particular note, at Osceola the official total of 6.95 set a new all-time 24-hour record for the 122 year-history of the station!||While some of this rain was actually much-needed/appreciated, various flooding issued ensued across several counties, affecting not only numerous rural roads and agricultural areas, but also several creeks and rivers, including: 1) Big Blue River, Clear Creek and Davis Creek in Polk County...2) Lincoln Creek and Beaver Creek in Hamilton and York counties...3) West Fork Big Blue River mainly between northwestern Clay and southern Hamilton counties. Most flooding (especially outside of Polk County) was relatively minor and confined to typical flood-prone areas, but issues persisted at least 36-48 hours in some places. Of all local counties, Polk County bore the brunt of flooding impacts, including: several rural roads damaged and impassable for at least few days, and fairly widespread flooding along the Davis Creek within Osceola. ||While thunderstorms were widespread during this roughly 15-hour convective event, the majority of them were sub-severe. Most severe storms occurred fairly early in the event (mainly 4-8 p.m. CDT) and yielded primarily large hail. One of the hardest-hit areas was in/near Fullerton, where stones up to baseball size fell. Elsewhere, quarter to ping pong ball size was reported in parts of Sherman, Howard, Nance and Merrick counties. There were only a few ground-truth reports of estimated severe winds, including 60-70 MPH near Loup City during the afternoon and 60 MPH in Cambridge late in the night along an invading squall line. ||Looking closer at timing, a few strong to marginally severe storms actually brushed northern parts of the area during the morning/early afternoon. However, the main event got underway near and north of the Nebraska Highway 92 corridor between 3:30-5:30 p.m. CDT as fairly isolated/intense cells erupted along a northward-shifting warm front/retreating outflow boundary. Over the next several hours, the severity of storms gradually waned, but the coverage of convection and heavy rain greatly increased as a strengthening low level jet interacted with a southward-drifting, west-east oriented outflow boundary. Through midnight CDT, the vast majority of convection focused near and north of the Interstate 80 corridor. Then after midnight, another area of storms pushed in from the west in the form of a northeast-southwest oriented squall line, but this activity was largely sub-severe as it crossed all of South Central Nebraska. By daybreak on the 16th, only an area of lighter stratiform rain remained, before finally departing the eastern fringes of the local area by mid-morning. ||Turning to the meteorological background behind this event, the primary factors were: 1) the presence of a very moist airmass characterized by surface dewpoints between the mid 60s-low 70s F...2) a generally west-oriented surface front stretched near the Interstate 80 corridor...3) A southerly low level jet of 30-40 knots ramping up after dark into the frontal zone. In the mid-upper levels, several small-scale disturbances were passing through the region, downstream of a primary trough axis advancing out of the Central Rockies. Around the time of the most intense afternoon storms, mixed-layer CAPE averaged 2000-3000 J/kg, but deep-layer wind shear held at-or-below 30 knots, fostering slow storm motions and heavy rainfall.",A 24-hour precipitation amount of 3.98 inches was recorded 2 miles north of Palmer.,86400.0,0 to 2.5k

This led to flash flooding and river flooding that continued into 01 July 2018. Some of the rivers remained in flood through much of July, and the West Fork of the Des Moines River at Estherville remained in flood through nearly all of July. ||Previous write-up from 30 June 2018|A frontal boundary was draped across areas just west of Iowa during the morning hours of June 30th, and slowly moved eastward into the state throughout the day. By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well.","Public reported heavy rainfall of 3.50 inches. Due to database entry limitation, beginning time coded as midnight CST.

These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred. ||Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum. ||On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat.",Total rainfall over the past 24 hours of 4.14 inches was reported by a Nebraska Rainfall Assessment and Information Network observer.,86400.0,0 to 2.5k

An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  These storms moved east-northeast along the warm front into Iowa, causing a considerable amount of severe weather.  Severe weather parameters were fairly strong, however the dynamics of a 100 kt mid level jet and 60 kt low level jet made up the difference.  Just prior to the storm development, CAPE values were around 4000 J/kg south of the development.  Helicity was high, in the 300 to 500 range.  There was a large amount of effective shear with 50 to 65 kts available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere was in the 200 to 400 J/kg range, while downdraft CAPE was 600 to 800 J/kg.  Plenty of low level moisture was drawn into the state on the strong low level jet.  Precipitable water vales rose to 1.25 inches quite rapidly.  The LCL level was relatively high, but given the dynmics was relatively easy to overcome.  The LCL was just under 1000 meters at the beginning of the event.  There were three tornadoes reported during the event.  One was northwest of the Creston area in Union County.  The most significant tornado caused high end EF2 damage to the far northwest corner of Creston. This tornado formed southwest of Cromwell at 1752 CST in Adams county and quickly tracked into northwest Creston around 1800 CST. EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.

Focusing first on the severe weather aspect, the afternoon and evening featured several reports of large hail and damaging winds within various counties. Storm mode was primarily multicell, some of which started out as semi-discrete before eventually merging into larger clusters and lines. Most hail reports were in the nickel to half dollar size range, with 1.25 diameter stones reported near Elwood and Lexington. However, one storm that tracked north of Lexington around 6 p.m. CDT was a prolific hail-producer, as a storm chaser reported a short stretch of Highway 21 completely hail-covered with most stones averaging golf ball size but one as large as 3 in diameter. As for damaging winds, there were primarily three noteworthy storms. First off, a cluster of severe storms shifted eastward into the Valley/Sherman counties area between 5:30-6:30 p.m. CDT. In Arcadia, the NWS cooperative observer estimated 70 MPH gusts, with 10-12 diameter tree limbs down. A bit later, a storm became severe near the Franklin/Kearney County line around 7 p.m. CDT and rapidly tracked northeast during the next few hours. Along the way, estimated 70 MPH winds overturned seven empty freight cars of a 72-car train near Kenesaw in extreme western Adams County. This storm weakened before reaching Grand Island, with only 50-60 MPH gusts reported on the south side of town around 8:30 p.m. CDT. While the train-toppling storm was in progress, a separate severe storm to its northeast passed through Merrick and northern Hamilton counties, causing tree and power line damage in Central City and Hordville around 8 p.m. CDT. By 9 p.m. CDT, storms had largely settled below severe-limits, with just one additional 60 MPH wind report along the Franklin/Webster County line. Through the remainder of the night, scattered to numerous showers and non-severe storms persisted over much of South Central Nebraska, with most counties finally rain-free by sunrise. As for rainfall amounts, the majority of the 24-county area totaled 1-2. However, there were a few smaller pockets of at least 2-3, most notably within York, northern Hamilton and southwestern Polk counties, where NeRAIN observers reported 3.46 near Hordville and 3.24 near Benedict.  Although a few dry days leading up to this event had allowed the York County area to start drying out in the wake of flooding rains that fell primarily on the 4th-5th, this event resulted in renewed short-term flooding issues. Most notably this involved the West Fork Big Blue River near McCool Junction, which again came out of its banks during the day on the 11th, only a few days after historic flooding occurred. Fortunately, flooding was not as severe this time around, and the river largely fell back into its banks by the end of the day on Friday the 12th (please refer to the June 4th p.m.-June 5th a.m. episode narrative for much more detail regarding multiple days of flooding along the West Fork Big Blue River). ||Most of the timing details of this severe weather event were already covered in the preceding paragraph, as all hail/strong wind reports occurred between 4:00-9:30 p.m. CDT. However, the first strong storms of the afternoon actually developed eastward into the Dawson/Gosper counties area as early as 2:30-4:00 p.m. CDT. Turning to the synoptic and mesoscale setup: the primary trigger aloft was a series of fairly subtle disturbances gradually overspreading the Central Plains, out ahead of a modest shortwave trough drifting southeast toward the region from the Northern Rockies. At the surface, a few different boundaries helped to focus convection, including a generally west-to-east oriented quasi-stationary front draped through central Nebraska and also a trough axis extending southwest from the local area to weak low pressure centered near the KS/CO border. With afternoon temperatures rising between 90-95 degrees, storms erupted in an environment featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of 0-6 kilometer deep layer wind shear.

Between midnight and 1 a.m. CST, small, isolated single-cell thunderstorms developed over central Nebraska, between Ainsworth and Lexington. As the night progressed, they were joined by more storms with an increasing trend toward a multicell convective mode as a common cold pool formed. The southern end of the developing MCS drifted eastward into Valley and Sherman Counties, with the deep convection on the west side of the MCS remaining quasi-stationary. After 6 a.m. CST, the northern portion of the MCS (over the Sandhills) weakened while the southern portion became dominant. By 6:30 a.m. CST, the dominant storms evolved into a short east-west oriented squall line across Sherman and Howard Counties. This line subsequently dropped southeast across Hall between 7 and 8 a.m. CST, then continued all the way down to Hebron, exiting south central Nebraska a little after 10 a.m. CST. Cell training produced a north-northwest to south-southeast oriented swath of 3 to 5 inches of rain across Valley, Sherman, and Howard Counties.

This led to flash flooding and river flooding that continued into 01 July 2018. Some of the rivers remained in flood through much of July, and the West Fork of the Des Moines River at Estherville remained in flood through nearly all of July. ||Previous write-up from 30 June 2018|A frontal boundary was draped across areas just west of Iowa during the morning hours of June 30th, and slowly moved eastward into the state throughout the day. By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency.

Conditions had been relatively dry prior to the rain and as a result, most of the flooding was limited to urban and small stream flooding.  General flooding occurred in Tama County in several locations.  Water was reported over both state and U.S. highways for several hours.  Flash flooding occurred in Wayne County with several roads covered with water flowing car bumper deep.  Reports from the county indicated that there was extensive road damage with at least 50 washouts.",Local TV station viewer reported 5.25 inches of rain in Promise City overnight through 7 AM this morning.,0.0,0 to 2.5k

This led to flash flooding and river flooding that continued into 01 July 2018. Some of the rivers remained in flood through much of July, and the West Fork of the Des Moines River at Estherville remained in flood through nearly all of July. ||Previous write-up from 30 June 2018|A frontal boundary was draped across areas just west of Iowa during the morning hours of June 30th, and slowly moved eastward into the state throughout the day. By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well.","CoCoRaHS observer recorded heavy rainfall of 7.15 inches over the last 24 hours.

Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1000 to 1300 J/kg range, with 400 to 600 J/kg in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere.  The shear was quite weak, in the 25 to 35 kt range.  Deep moisture was in place with precipitable water values of 1.8 inches.  The LCL was quite low as well, in the 500 to 750 meter range.  There was little hail as the freezing level was quite high at 14,400 feet.  Strong thunderstorms developed in a north to south line across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  During the morning the line took on a bow echo appearance as bow beta elements began to push rapidly east.  A swath of 60 to 70 MPH winds took place from east of the Omaha-Council Bulffs area in southwest Iowa all the way east into central Iowa in the Marshalltown and Oskaloosa areas.  The high winds overturned semi-tractortrailer trucks in Guthrie and Greene Counties.  Shingles were also blown from a house in Guthrie Count west of Guthrie Center.  In Audubon County, high winds lifted two farm buildings off of their post foundations and carried them one quarter of a mile away.  A funnel cloud was observed west of Eldora in Hardin County.  Very heavy rainfall occurred over parts of northeast Iowa.  Franklin, Butler, and Grundy Counties were hard hit.  Numerous roads and highways were under water and closed as 4 to over 7 inches of rain fell in under six hours.  The heaviest rainfall total was in the Aplington Area in Butler County.  A total of 7.5 inches fell there.  Severe flooding took place in the New Hartford area.  Near record high river stages prompted the evacuation of the town.

Afternoon temperatures warmed into the upper 80s to mid 90s, with dewpoint readings in the upper 70s to low 80s.  A weak boundary extended out of eastern Nebraska across northern Iowa.  This boundary helped to focus moisture.  At the same time, a negatively tilted shortwave lifted northeast out of the Rockies into Nebraska during the afternoon and early evening.  The lifted index fell to -10 to -14 C by evening with CAPE rising to 5000-7000 J/kg in the very moist airmass.  The freezing level was very high, between 16,000 and 17,000 feet.  As a result, there was little in the way of hail.  The downdraft CAPE was quite high, 800 to 1400 J/kg.  Thunderstorms formed in northeast Nebraska.  They rapidly formed into an upscale MCS, and eventually a full-fledged MCC.  Precipitable water values were extremely high, in the 2.5 to 2.75 inch range.  The primary mode of severe weather with the system was in the form of high wind.  Wind gusts of 60 to 70 MPH caused sporadic damage across western into central Iowa with tree damage, as well as damage to outbuildings.  The storms produced one funnel cloud in Carroll County.  The high precipitable water values led to very heavy rainfall with widespread flash flooding.  A swath of 2 to 5 inch rainfall extended from west central, through central, into parts of southeast Iowa.  There were numerous reports of a foot or more of flowing water over streets.  Following the flash flooding, water remained standing on many roads due to the soils across the state being nearly saturated.  This resulted in some road closures.  The Des Moines metropolitan area was hard hit as 3 to 5 inches of rain fell in 4 hours or less.  This caused extensive flooding in the city.  Some evacuations took place.  One was at a trailer court along Four Mile Creek on the east side of Des Moines.  Numerous roads were closed on the west side as well as Walnut Creek jumped its banks.  In fact, the creek set an all-time record high stage.  Fast rising waters of North Walnut Creek flooded four basement apartment units in Clive with water rescues taking place.  Lightning struck a house in Adel, setting it on fire.  The family was asleep at the time and were rescued by the fire department after the house had been on fire for 45 minutes.  Damage to the house was around $1,000,000 as it was a total loss, burned to the ground.  In Black Hawk County, lightning struck the water treatment plant in Cedar Falls.  Power was knocked out, resulting in the discharge of 750,000 gallons of sewage into the Cedar River.  Lightning struck the historical depot in Carroll, now the Chamber of Commerce, and caused minor damage to the roof.

This led to flash flooding and river flooding that continued into 01 July 2018. Some of the rivers remained in flood through much of July, and the West Fork of the Des Moines River at Estherville remained in flood through nearly all of July. ||Previous write-up from 30 June 2018|A frontal boundary was draped across areas just west of Iowa during the morning hours of June 30th, and slowly moved eastward into the state throughout the day. By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well.","Public reported storm total heavy rainfall of 9.20 inches. Due to database entry limitation, beginning time coded as midnight CST.

This type of weather pattern favors the development of precipitation across the Panhandle as it allows weak shortwave troughs to dive southeastward from the Continental Divide into the Southern Plains. The large scale lift provided by one such shortwave during the afternoon hours of the 7th worked in tandem with weak steering flow during the afternoon and increasing PWAT values during the evening hours to produce localized heavy rain across the Texas Panhandle. Scattered, near stationary, discrete thunderstorms developed over the northern Texas Panhandle due to weak steering flow during the afternoon hours of the 7th. These storms were able to generate moderate rain amounts due to being over the same location for an extended period of time. As the hours progressed into the evening, low level winds transported gulf moisture into the southern Texas Panhandle which fueled, in the form of increased PWAT values, a line of thunderstorms moving south-southeastward across the western half of the Panhandle. While these storms moved quickly across the area, the ample supply of moisture allowed these thunderstorms to efficiently produce heavy rain. All precipitation ended across the Texas Panhandle by 10 PM due to the upper level support for these storms moving into central Texas.","Residual showers moved over Hansford County during the late evening hours of the 7th.

Numerous roads and highways were under water and closed as 4 to over 7 inches of rain fell in under six hours.  The heaviest rainfall total was in the Aplington Area in Butler County.  A total of 7.5 inches fell there.  Severe flooding took place in the New Hartford area.  Near record high river stages prompted the evacuation of the town.  In Parkersburg, 1500 to 2000 feet of railroad tracks were washed out.  There was some hail with the storms.  Most of them had small hail, though no significant hail was reported.",Rainfall total for the previous 24 hours ending 0600 CST was 1.80 inches.,0.0,0 to 2.5k

A few of the storms produced large hail and severe wind gusts as several bow echoes formed. However, the main hazard became the extremely heavy rainfall with bouts of rainfall rates as high as 2 to 3 inches per hour. ||By Thursday morning, a large area of 3 to 6 inches of rain fell between Appleton City to Willmar and Hutchinson, southward to Granite Falls and Redwood Falls. Inside this area, there was a smaller area of 6 to 8 inches of rain that fell between Appleton City to Willmar, southward to Olivia. The highest totals were near Olivia and Willmar where two local observations measured 8.78 and 8.09 inches respectfully.  ||These amounts set the stage for areal and river flooding, with some flash flooding where rainfall rates maximized during the evening near Hutchinson.||This was also the second Mega-rain event this year.

Strong thunderstorms developed over southern Minnesota.  Initially, the thunderstorms moved east.  Once they became more rooted in the boundary layer, they moved southeast and propagated nearly due south.  The main severe threat was high winds, with numerous reports of tree, power line, and grain bin damage.  Winds of 70 MPH were measured in Estherville for example.  Seventy MPH winds were reported in Grundy County.  The outflow boundary from the complex continued to move southeast, and actually moved all the way into Missouri.  Scattered severe weather occurred with this.  Seven power poles were snapped in Polk County by the high winds.  A wind gust of 62 MPH occurred at the Ottumwa Airport.  Flash flooding also became a problem with the antecedent soil conditions nearly saturated.  Flash flooding in Emmet County resulted in the closing of Highway 4 near Wallingford and evacuations in the city.  A secondary area of thunderstorms formed over northwest Iowa and moved east-southeast into the CWA.  Heavy rains caused minor urban flooding in Calhoun County with 6 inches of standing water reported in the city of Pomeroy.

This event produced between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall in less than 3 hours, with some areas receiving 3 to 4 inches of rain in less than 90 minutes based on local observations. The second event produced an additional 2 to 4 inches after 9 PM CST in the same areas which prompted a small region to have a Flash Flood Emergency issued. Upwards of 7, to nearly 10 inches of rain fell before midnight. Due to this extreme event, there were hundreds of abandoned cars with water reaching the car windows in northwest metro suburbs during the height of the storm. Interstate 94 in the north metro was closed for a period that night. Five private residents had 3-4 feet of water in their basements, and two homes had water completed filled to the top in Maple Grove. In addition to the homes, there were 15 county roads closed at one point around Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park based on reports from the Hennepin County Emergency Management. A small part of Highway 169 near the border of Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park was closed for 4 days due to the runoff from earlier torrential rainfall.  ||The other flash flood event occurred near Mankato (northeast Blue Earth County) eastward through Waseca and Steele Counties. Thunderstorms that developed Wednesday evening were much more widespread, and trained over the same areas along and north of the front. Rainfall amounts ranged from 4 to 6 inches from Mankato, to Albert Lea, Kenyon and Faribault. The highest 24-hour total ending on the morning of September 22 was 7.64 inches at the U of M Southern Research and Outreach Center in Waseca. This brought the two-day total at that location to 10.16 inches, including the 2.52 inches of rain that fell with the first wave on September 20-21. This is the highest two-day total ever recorded in Waseca.||Due to the ground that was already saturated from earlier torrential rainfall the day before, the flooding situation became extreme, with ongoing areal flooding lasting for  the next several days as the runoff continued. ||There were many reports of basements flooded, closed roads and washouts, and standing water in Waseca and other locations as well. There were a few homes in Waseca that were evacuated due to the flood waters. The indoor ice arena in Waseca had six inches of water on the freshly-iced rink. Loon Lake in Waseca rose over its banks and flooded nearby streets in town. The rising waters of Fountain Lake in Albert Lea encroached into town during the day on September 23, detouring Highway 65 (Main Street) near the lake.||According to the emergency manager at least 75 percent of the homes in the Waseca area were damaged by flooding. A line nearly 200 yards long of trucks and cars filled with wet carpets, furniture and waterlogged TVs and appliances was lined up at the City of Waseca debris dump site. ||There was major flooding on rivers and creeks across portions of southern Minnesota that lasted for several days beyond the event. The North Fork Zumbro River near Wanamingo reached a record flood stage of 23.38 feet during the morning of 9/22. The previous record was 23.2 feet. Other rivers, and streams that rose significant or crested above flood stage were the Straight, Cannon, Cobb and Le Sueur. ||During the height of the flood event, I-694, I-90, and Highway 169 in Minnesota were closed for a time due to high water. Dozens of county roads were also closed near Waseca, Minnesota in south central MN. Many stalled vehicles, flooded basements and a few localized evacuations took place around southern Minnesota.||Reports from the Minnesota Department of Transportation had numerous state roads closed through Thursday, September 22nd as runoff continued. Some of the major roads that were affected by the flood waters in south central Minnesota included; Highways 13, 14, 30, 71, 83, 22, 28, and 15.  ||Several of the main roads didn't reopen until Friday morning, September 23rd. Plus, a few didn't open until the following week. ||In addition to the road closures, several gravel roads experienced erosion.  Within the Blue Earth County Park System, Wildwood Park and the Fort Le Hillier Canoe Landing had been closed.||Several daily rainfall records were broken which included; Waseca at 7.64 inches, 5.15 inches at Wells, 3.70 inches at Zumbrota, and 3.09 inches at Winnebago. ||Due to the extreme event, the President of the United States officially declared the significant storm and flooding in September a major disaster. This declaration brought federal and state aid to the following counties: Blue Earth, Freeborn, Goodhue, Le Sueur, Rice, Steele, Waseca, and others in southeast Minnesota. ||The widespread flooding caused significant damage to roads, buildings, and infrastructure. According to a preliminary damage report completed in October 2016, officials determined $8.3 million in public infrastructure damage and $10.1 million in estimated individual needs were noted. Over 6,000 homes and businesses were affected by the flood waters across southern Minnesota.","A local trained weather observer measured 5.25 inches of rainfall near Eagle Lake between Wednesday afternoon, September 21st, to the early morning of Thursday, September 22nd.",43200.0,0 to 2.5k

A deep flow of tropical moisture into the Appalachians and central mid Atlantic region ahead of the storm began to generate excessive rainfall across portions of the region as early as Wednesday evening, mainly along the Interstate 77 corridor, causing some degree of flash flooding and otherwise saturating the ground even before the arrival of the rainfall directly associated with Michael.||As the storm circulation approached on Thursday, a cold front moving in from the west and interacted with the storm and enhanced rainfall especially east of Interstate 81.

Although nearly the entire 24-county area observed thunderstorm activity, there were two primary corridors of severe storms. In the west, Dawson County bore the brunt of severe weather with reports of quarter to golf ball size hail and estimated wind gusts up to 80 MPH. Just west of Gothenburg, four empty rail cars were blown over, and in Lexington, two empty semi trailers were toppled. Farther east, a more widespread corridor of severe storms initially entered far northern counties such as Valley, Greeley and Nance, before propagating southeast across the eastern Hall, Hamilton and Clay County areas before weakening. North of Interstate 80 most storm reports were marginally severe, consisting of quarter size hail and wind gusts to around 60 MPH, including a measured 59 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island. However, storm mergers resulted in a notable upswing in storm intensity over southern Hamilton and especially Clay County, which was overall hardest-hit from a combination of quarter to golf ball size hail and winds estimated up to 80 MPH. This combo resulted in a significant swath of crop destruction, with radar data and limited reports suggesting that the worst crop damage extended roughly 30 miles from southwestern Hamilton County near Giltner through the Harvard, Clay Center and Edgar areas. Other notable storm reports included an irrigation center pivot blown onto Highway 6 southeast of Inland, along with a farm storage shed destroyed in the same area. Farther south, Edgar suffered significant wind damage, especially to trees but also to some structures. A grain bin that blew onto railroad tracks in Edgar was actually struck by a train, shutting down the tracks for several hours (this was the second significant severe weather event to strike Edgar in recent months, following an EF2 tornado on May 27th). Although a few storms during the evening exhibited radar-indicated rotation, and a funnel cloud was reported northeast of Wolbach shortly before 7 pm CDT, there were no confirmed tornadoes within the area. In addition to hail and wind, various locations received heavy rainfall of 2-4 inches, although flooding issues were held to a minimum. A few of the highest-known measured storm totals featured 3.90 near Cozad and 3.80 near Edgar. ||Breaking down event timing, several hours prior to the evening main show, an initial series of strong to marginally severe multicell storms developed southward out of north central Nebraska and skirted far northeast portions of the local area mainly between 8 am-noon CDT. The only report from this early activity was nickel size hail at Spalding. Following a multiple-hour lull, clusters of severe storms again built southward into primarily the northeast quadrant of South Central Nebraska between 6-8 pm CDT, a continuation of activity that initially flared up along the South Dakota border earlier in the afternoon. As these eastern storms started to concentrate near the Interstate 80 corridor around 9 pm CDT, a separate cluster of severe storms including an embedded supercell initiated just northwest of the local area over Custer County and dropped slowly southward into Dawson County between 930-11 pm CDT. During this same 930-11 pm CDT time frame, the eastern storms also intensified as multiple cells including another embedded supercell merged into a southward-surging MCS, creating the swath of Clay County damage before steadily weakening along the Nuckolls-Thayer County line. Over time, both the eastern and western convection joined together along a common outflow, gradually losing intensity and drifting southward through southern portions of the area. All thunderstorm activity finally vacated the entire 24-county area around 5 am CDT on the 2nd. On the synoptic scale aloft, this was a fairly weakly-forced event, with an absence of notable shortwave troughs within a west-northwest flow regime sandwiched between an upper ridge centered over the southern High Plains and an expansive low centered near Hudson Bay. However, mid-upper flow was seasonably strong over Nebraska, resulting in a favorable severe weather environment with 0-6 kilometer vertical wind shear around 40 knots during the evening hours. In the low-levels, convergence along a developing east-west warm front was the primary focus for initial afternoon development across northern Nebraska. As these storms propagated/developed southward into the local area, they encountered an unstable air mass featuring most-unstable CAPE values around 2000 J/kg and plenty of low-level moisture, evidenced by surface dewpoints well into the mid-upper 60s F. The southward propagation of convection was also aided by a southerly, 850 millibar low level jet ramping up to around 40 knots.",A 12 hour total of 3.11 inches fell through 7 am CDT.

Given the area's location in relation to the surface low, severe weather was of little concern with nominal to moderate CAPE at best and little other support for organized storms of any kind. Precipitable water values were in excess of 1.5 inches through the 19th and well into the 20th, helping produce efficient and continuous rainfall as the upper level trough and surface low slowly moved through.

These storms forced delays or cancellations to a number of high school football games during what turned into a fairly prolonged event, with wind and hail-producing storms first flaring up around 230 PM CDT, and finally diminishing in intensity around 1 AM. The majority of severe storms and heavy rainfall regenerated for several hours within a narrow southwest-northeast oriented corridor only about 30 miles wide at most, primarily impacting counties such as Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo, Howard, Hall and northwest Adams. The storm mode was a mixed bag of quasi-discrete, fast moving supercells and small multicell bowing segments. Storm reports included several instances of damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of golf balls. A few of the more notable reports were from Atlanta in Phelps County, including golf ball size hail and significant wind damage to the roof of a grain storage building. At the Holdrege airport, two separate storms produced measured gusts to around 60 MPH, several hours apart from one another. Although a few storms exhibited low-level rotation, no tornadoes occurred. ||Heavy rainfall-wise, parts of primarily eastern Furnas, northwest Harlan, Phelps, Buffalo and southeast Sherman Counties measured 3-6 inches of rain during this event, including 5.94 inches northwest of Oxford and 5.33 inches in Loomis. Kearney Regional Airport established a record for the date with 2.29 inches. Although the heaviest rain associated with this low pressure system fell during these storms on the afternoon and evening of the 7th, additional rain throughout the weekend boosted 3-day totals into the 6-7 inch range for some areas, highlighted by 7.13 inches at Loomis. Fortunately, due to the very dry conditions leading up to this event, widespread flooding impacts were held to a minimum. ||On the synoptic scale, the primary trigger for severe weather was the approach of a highly amplified mid-level trough across the western United States, anchored by a closed low swinging through the Four Corners region. Downstream from this low, a corridor of strong, nearly unidirectional south-southwest winds was in place in the mid and upper levels. At the surface, storm development focused along a quasi-stationary front, which at mid-afternoon stretched from eastern South Dakota to southwest Kansas. Given that winds aloft were largely parallel to this southwest-northeast oriented surface front, convection was able to focus within the aforementioned narrow corridor, with individual storms within the corridor racing northeast. Mesoscale parameters at early evening revealed only modest instability, with mixed-layer CAPE values only around 1000 J/kg, but in the presence of very strong deep-layer vertical wind shear of 50-60 knots. Although low-level shear ramped up as the evening progressed, with 0-1 kilometer shear values increasing to 30-40 knots, the combination of increasing low level convective inhibition and multiple storm mergers likely helped mitigate a potential tornadic threat.",Total rainfall over the past 24 hours of 3.60 inches was reported by a Nebraska Rainfall Assessment and Information Network observer.,86400.0,0 to 2.5k

Several of these storms were strong to severe, and one storm produced straight-line wind damage in Quitaque, including lifting the top of the town water tower off. However, the more widespread impact was very heavy rainfall that produced flash flooding over a large chunk of the southeast Panhandle into the northern Rolling Plains. Caprock Canyons State Park recorded 4.02 inches of rainfall, which fell at torrential rates measured as high as 12 inches per hour for a brief period. The extreme rainfall rates led to large amounts of runoff and widespread flooding. A road in the state park was flooded in two locations when the South Prong of the Little Red River became swollen. In addition, numerous other roadways were flooded across Briscoe, Hall, southwest Childress, and northern Cottle Counties. The flooding gradually subsided by the early afternoon hours after storms exited to the southeast. This morning complex of storms produced a large outflow boundary that surged westward onto the Caprock by midday and helped fuel the development of more severe weather later this afternoon.

The weather pattern, and associated boundaries were nearly stationary through early Thursday morning, September 22nd. The atmosphere was very moist, which was evident in the soundings as near record high Precipitable Water (PWAT) values were noted.  ||Although the most significant part of this weather event was flooding, some large hail was observed the evening of September 20th, and during the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, September 21st. ||The evening of Tuesday, September 20th, an area of thunderstorms formed along and north of the warm front in southern Minnesota. Heavy rain fell in south central Minnesota, especially near Waseca. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for portions of southern Minnesota but no major issues were reported. Ultimately, 2 to 3 inches of rain fell in a rather short period of time near Janesville and Waseca late Tuesday night. This rainfall event, although localized, created very wet antecedent conditions before the main heavy rainfall event developed the evening of Wednesday, September 21st.||The evening and overnight of September 21st-22nd saw much more and widespread heavy rainfall across southern Minnesota. Two areas that were hit the hardest occurred across Hennepin and Anoka counties, in the Twin Cities metro area, and around Mankato, Waseca and Owatonna. ||The worst and most significant flash flood event occurred between Greenfield, Corcoran in Hennepin County, eastward to Spring Lake Park, Fridley, Lexington and Lino Lakes in Anoka County. The first heavy rainfall event occurred between 5 PM and 8 PM CST. This event produced between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall in less than 3 hours, with some areas receiving 3 to 4 inches of rain in less than 90 minutes based on local observations. The second event produced an additional 2 to 4 inches after 9 PM CST in the same areas which prompted a small region to have a Flash Flood Emergency issued. Upwards of 7, to nearly 10 inches of rain fell before midnight. Due to this extreme event, there were hundreds of abandoned cars with water reaching the car windows in northwest metro suburbs during the height of the storm. Interstate 94 in the north metro was closed for a period that night. Five private residents had 3-4 feet of water in their basements, and two homes had water completed filled to the top in Maple Grove. In addition to the homes, there were 15 county roads closed at one point around Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park based on reports from the Hennepin County Emergency Management. A small part of Highway 169 near the border of Maple Grove and Brooklyn Park was closed for 4 days due to the runoff from earlier torrential rainfall.  ||The other flash flood event occurred near Mankato (northeast Blue Earth County) eastward through Waseca and Steele Counties. Thunderstorms that developed Wednesday evening were much more widespread, and trained over the same areas along and north of the front. Rainfall amounts ranged from 4 to 6 inches from Mankato, to Albert Lea, Kenyon and Faribault. The highest 24-hour total ending on the morning of September 22 was 7.64 inches at the U of M Southern Research and Outreach Center in Waseca. This brought the two-day total at that location to 10.16 inches, including the 2.52 inches of rain that fell with the first wave on September 20-21. This is the highest two-day total ever recorded in Waseca.||Due to the ground that was already saturated from earlier torrential rainfall the day before, the flooding situation became extreme, with ongoing areal flooding lasting for  the next several days as the runoff continued. ||There were many reports of basements flooded, closed roads and washouts, and standing water in Waseca and other locations as well. There were a few homes in Waseca that were evacuated due to the flood waters. The indoor ice arena in Waseca had six inches of water on the freshly-iced rink. Loon Lake in Waseca rose over its banks and flooded nearby streets in town. The rising waters of Fountain Lake in Albert Lea encroached into town during the day on September 23, detouring Highway 65 (Main Street) near the lake.||According to the emergency manager at least 75 percent of the homes in the Waseca area were damaged by flooding. A line nearly 200 yards long of trucks and cars filled with wet carpets, furniture and waterlogged TVs and appliances was lined up at the City of Waseca debris dump site. ||There was major flooding on rivers and creeks across portions of southern Minnesota that lasted for several days beyond the event. The North Fork Zumbro River near Wanamingo reached a record flood stage of 23.38 feet during the morning of 9/22. The previous record was 23.2 feet. Other rivers, and streams that rose significant or crested above flood stage were the Straight, Cannon, Cobb and Le Sueur. ||During the height of the flood event, I-694, I-90, and Highway 169 in Minnesota were closed for a time due to high water. Dozens of county roads were also closed near Waseca, Minnesota in south central MN. Many stalled vehicles, flooded basements and a few localized evacuations took place around southern Minnesota.||Reports from the Minnesota Department of Transportation had numerous state roads closed through Thursday, September 22nd as runoff continued. Some of the major roads that were affected by the flood waters in south central Minnesota included; Highways 13, 14, 30, 71, 83, 22, 28, and 15.  ||Several of the main roads didn't reopen until Friday morning, September 23rd. Plus, a few didn't open until the following week. ||In addition to the road closures, several gravel roads experienced erosion.  Within the Blue Earth County Park System, Wildwood Park and the Fort Le Hillier Canoe Landing had been closed.||Several daily rainfall records were broken which included; Waseca at 7.64 inches, 5.15 inches at Wells, 3.70 inches at Zumbrota, and 3.09 inches at Winnebago. ||Due to the extreme event, the President of the United States officially declared the significant storm and flooding in September a major disaster. This declaration brought federal and state aid to the following counties: Blue Earth, Freeborn, Goodhue, Le Sueur, Rice, Steele, Waseca, and others in southeast Minnesota. ||The widespread flooding caused significant damage to roads, buildings, and infrastructure. According to a preliminary damage report completed in October 2016, officials determined $8.3 million in public infrastructure damage and $10.1 million in estimated individual needs were noted.

Partially due to an infusion of tropical moisture from former hurricane Norbert, the storms produced intense rainfall with rainfall rates commonly in excess of 2 inches per hour and in some cases, in excess of 6 inches per hour for short periods of time. By the middle of the morning, most of the central deserts had received over two inches of rain, and many locations across the greater Phoenix metropolitan area picked up between 3 and 6 inches of rainfall. Phoenix Sky Harbor airport received 3.29 inches of rainfall with this event; the rain total set an all time record for any calendar date. The rainfall caused widespread flash flooding followed by flooding; numerous roads were closed. Several freeways were closed, including Interstate 10, as pumping stations failed and lakes several feet deep formed across portions of the freeways. Hundreds of cars were stranded across the greater Phoenix area, many buried to the top of their hoods in flood waters. Hundreds of homes and apartment complexes across the greater Phoenix area were flooded. Heavy rains damaged roofs across the valley, and collapsed the roof of a Fry's grocery store in Tempe.

By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst.
